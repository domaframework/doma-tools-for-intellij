    This action converts SQL statements from SQL files into Sql annotations for DAO methods.<br>
    By selecting a DAO method and executing the action, the corresponding SQL will be embedded as an annotation in the appropriate DAO method.<br>
    This makes it easier to manage SQL directly within the source code and improves code readability and maintainability.
